# Weighted_planar_stochastic_lattice
This program generates and analyzes the Weighted Planar Stochastic Lattice (WPSL), a random spatial tiling formed by repeatedly subdividing rectangles within a unit square. At each step of the construction, one rectangle is selected from the current set of rectangles, with the likelihood of selection determined by the rectangle's area (i.e., larger rectangles are more likely to be picked). Once a rectangle is chosen, it is divided at a random point within its boundaries—both the horizontal and vertical cut positions are chosen randomly—resulting in four new smaller rectangles. The original rectangle is then removed, and these four new rectangles are added to the lattice. By repeating this process over many iterations, the lattice evolves into a complex tiling made up of rectangles of varying sizes and shapes. The code computes the degree distribution of rectangles (i.e., the number of immediate neighbors each has), outputs both linear and logarithmic degree statistics, and calculates the sum of the cubes of rectangle widths as a characteristic measure. The simulation is averaged over multiple ensembles for statistical accuracy, and the results are written to output files for further analysis of spatial network properties.
